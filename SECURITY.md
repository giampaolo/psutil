# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report
it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue**. This gives me time to
fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that an exploit will
be used before a patch is released.

To report a security vulnerability use the
[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security). Tidelift will
coordinate the fix and the disclosure of the reported problem.
